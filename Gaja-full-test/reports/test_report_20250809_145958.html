First, it never authenticates \u2013 each user request is met with the same \u201cBrak tokena JWT\u201d error, so the scenario\u2019s premise (an advanced assistant handling reminders, tasks, and weather) is utterly unrealized. Second, the bot\u2019s responses are mechanically identical, lacking any contextual awareness or incremental dialogue; it does not even acknowledge the user\u2019s previous messages beyond repeating the authentication failure. Third, the tone is flat and robotic, devoid of empathy or helpfulness, which makes it sound like a poorly trained script rather than a competent AI. Fourth, the logic is incoherent: the bot refuses to perform any action while simultaneously claiming to be \u201cadvanced,\u201d creating a paradox that undermines trust. Finally, the overall professionalism is zero\u2014no attempt at politeness, no fallback handling, and no graceful degradation; it simply blocks every request with a generic error, which is unacceptable for any real-world assistant.",
