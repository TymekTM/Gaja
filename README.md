# Gaja

**Gaja** is an offline-first, self-hosted voice assistant built for people who care about control, speed, and privacy.
It runs fully locally, without requiring cloud services or API keys, and is designed to be extended through modular plugins.

> This repository is the **main distribution hub** for Gaja releases. Core logic and functionality live in separate submodules:
> [Gaja-Server](https://github.com/TymekTM/Gaja-Server), [Gaja-Client](https://github.com/TymekTM/Gaja-Client), and [Gaja-Web](https://github.com/TymekTM/Gaja-Web).


## What Makes Gaja Different?

Unlike most voice assistants, **Gaja does not rely on the cloud**. Everything happens on your device. No telemetry, no user accounts, no external dependencies unless explicitly enabled.

* **Modular:** Each component (STT, TTS, memory, plugins, UI) is independently manageable and replaceable.
* **Offline-first:** Gaja is usable out of the box without internet access.
* **Lightweight:** Quick to start, low on resources.
* **Extensible:** Add new functionality by dropping a Python file into the plugin folder.
* **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, Linux support under development.

## System Overview

Gaja is split into three main components:

| Component   | Purpose                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Gaja-Server | Manages plugins, memory, logic, and API endpoints  |
| Gaja-Client | Handles audio input/output and basic GUI           |
| Gaja-Web    | (Optional) Browser-based interface for interaction |

All communication happens locally. Each component is independent and replaceable.

* **Accessible architecture for hobbyists and power users alike**
